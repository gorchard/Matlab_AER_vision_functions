# Matlab_AER_vision_functions
This repository contains some commonly used Matlab functions for working with and displaying AER vision data
There is also an attempt to port some of these functions into objects - refer to the oop folder

Take a look at the "example.m" or "example_oop.m" script to see how to use the functions
